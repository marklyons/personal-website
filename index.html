      <h1>Mark Lyons</h1>
      <p>I am a software engineer based in New York City. I am originally from Erie, Pennsylvania and most recently lived in Baltimore, Maryland after graduating from the University of Maryland at College Park. However, I have found that New York is where I want to be for the foreseeable future. </p>
      <p>Within professional software engineering, I have experience in hardware, finance, and social media. Regardless of where I am at career wise, I am always excited to learn what people are working on and what they are passionate about. Please feel free to reach out. My personal email is <a href="mailto:lyons340@gmail.com">lyons340@gmail.com</a>.</p>
